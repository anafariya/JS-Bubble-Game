Event Bubbling
The concept of event bubbling plays a crucial role in this game. Event bubbling is a mechanism in which an event starts from the target element and bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM tree. In this game:

Each bubble is an element within the #panelbottom container.
The click event listener is attached to the #panelbottom container.
When a bubble is clicked, the event bubbles up to the container, and the event handler checks if the clicked bubble matches the current "Hit Value."
This efficient use of event bubbling simplifies the code and improves performance by handling all bubble clicks in one central location.
